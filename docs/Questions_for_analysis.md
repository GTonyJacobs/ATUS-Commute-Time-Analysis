# Questions for Analysis

#### 1. Socioeconomic Factors and Commute Time
Which socioeconomic factors are correlated with longer and shorter commute times? We investigate how commute time is influenced by age, income level, and having multiple jobs, as well as considering the possible modifying effects of sex and metropolitan status.
   
#### 2. Commute Time and Well-Being
How does total commute time relate to various well-being factors? We study the relation between total commute time and five different outcome variables: life rating, general health, and average reported levels of happiness, sadness, and stress.

#### 3. Commuting Stress and Well-Being
How does the stress level of commuting correlate with commuters' life ratings, general health, and hypertension? To control for the effect of stress unrelated to commuting, we analyze three groups of respondents: those who reported stress during their commutes to be less than, similar to, or greater than, their general stress levels throughout the day.

#### 4. Commuting and Sleep
How does commuting affect sleep? We examine the amount of sleep that respondents reported in 24 hours, investigating the effects of total commute time and of reported commuting stress.
