## Analysis 3 – Commuting Stress and Well-Being – Summary

Having seen in our second analysis the lack of relation between commute time and well-being, we turn from the quantity of work travel to its quality, in particular, how stressful the commuters find it to be. To examine this aspect, we consider the subset of our sample who not only participated in the Well-Being Module of the ATUS, but for whom commuting was among the three randomly selected activities for which they were asked to rate their moods. The sample we obtain in this way is smaller than the previous samples (N=533), because many participants were simply not asked about their mood during commuting, but we still have a large enough sample for meaningful analysis.

For these participants, we focus on the three outcome variables `life_rating`, `gen_health`, and `hyper_tens`. The question under consideration is whether a stressful commute has a pervasive effect on one's quality of life. Two of these variables, we saw in our second analysis; the third, `hyper_tens`, is based on the survey question, "In the last five years, were you ever told by a doctor or other health professional that you have hypertension, also called high blood pressure, or borderline hypertension?"

Considering that general stress affects health and quality of life, we focus on the effect of commuting stress by dividing our sample into four groups according to whether their stress was elevated more or less while they were traveling to work. In this way, we avoid the potentially confounding effect of overall stress on our results. The four groups are:

* Group 1 - Those who did not report feeling stress, either commuting or otherwise (N=138)
* Group 2 - Those who reported commuting stress at a *lower* level than general stress (N=132)
* Group 3 - Those who reported commuting stress at *about the same* level as general stress (N=127)
* Group 4 - Those who reported commuting stress at a *higher* level than general stress (N=136)

Our logistic regression takes Group 1 as a baseline, to which we compare Groups 2, 3, and 4, evaluating the extent to which membership in each of the more stressed groups is correlated with increased odds of low life rating, poor general health rating, or hypertension.

In the cases of life rating and general health, we find significant increases for members of the stressed groups, which is unsurprising. What is interesting is that this effect is more pronounced for members of Group 4, those for whom commuting was more stressful that the rest of the day. This effect is even more striking when we note that overall stress levels for Group 4 were lower than for Groups 2 and 3. With lower overall stress, Group 4 might be expected to report fewer negative ratings, and yet they report more, as if commuting stress is somehow more impactful than stress from other sources.

In the following visualization, we can see the difference between Group 4 and the other groups. While Groups 2 and 3 are twice as likely as Group 1 to report a lower life rating, Group 4 is nearly three times as likely as Group 1 to do so. Similarly, Group 4's odds of reporting poor general health are elevated above the odds for Group 1 even more than they are for Groups 2 and 3.

Column heights are ratios of odds for Groups 2, 3 and 4 to odds for Group 1, our baseline. For both outcome variables depicted here, the Group 4 column rises above the columns for Groups 2 and 3.](/images/Increased_odds_of_negative_outcome.png)
