## Analysis 3 â€“ Commuting Stress and Well-Being

### Summary

Here, we consider not only the quantity of commute time but also its quality, in particular, how stressful the commuters find it to be. In order to look at commuting stress, we look at a subset of our sample consisting of respondents who not only participated in the Well-Being Module of the ATUS, but for whom commuting was among the three randomly selected activities in which they were asked to rate their moods. The sample we obtain in this way is smaller than the previous samples (N=533), but still large enough for meaningful analysis.

For these participants, we examine the associations between `work_travel` and three outcome variables `life_rating`, `gen_health`, and `hyper_tens`, much as in the previous analysis. We have seen the first two of these already, and `hyper_tens` is based on the survey question, "In the last five years, were you ever told by a doctor or other health professional that you have hypertension, also called high blood pressure, or borderline hypertension?"

This time, however, we divide the sample into groups according to how they rated their commuting stress compared with their overall life stress.

* Group 1 - Those who did not report feeling stress, either commuting or otherwise
* Group 2 - Those who reported commuting stress at a *lower* level than general stress
* Group 3 - Those who reported commuting stress at *about the same* level as general stress
* Group 4 - Those who reported commuting stress at a *higher* level than general stress?sFinally, we perform a logistic regressions for each outcome variable against travel time, this time considering intersections with the four groups. (See below for details.)

Our regression analysis yields two notable results. Neither is strongly statistically significant, but both are suggestive.

* Among those who reported no stress, commuting is associated with a slight increase in the liklihood of having a high life rating (8, 9, or 10). Quantitatively, a respondent who commuted 10 minutes longer than another has odds of reporting a life rating of 8, 9, or 10 that are 6.5% higher. This suggests that, when life is not stressful, and the travel is not stressful, a longer commute can be associated with high life satisfaction. Whether there is a causal relationship remains unclear, but we do see a moderate association.
* Amongh those who rated commuting stress as higher than life stress in general, we see a moderate association between work travel time and a lower general health rating. Among this group, a respondent who commuted 10 minutes longer than another has odds of reporting their general health level as "excellent" or "very good" that were about 6% lower.
