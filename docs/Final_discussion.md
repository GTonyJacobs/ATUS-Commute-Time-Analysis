## Summary of Results

In our first analysis, we saw that certain demographic and socioeconomic factors combined in ways that are correlated with longer or shorter commutes. Among non-metropolitan women, but not among non-metropolitan men, we saw a mild but significant correlation between age and shorter work travel time. Among all metropolitan residents, we saw a correlation between having multiple jobs and longer work travel time. The second of these results, while in a way unsurprising, is interesting in being restricted to metropolitan commuters. More jobs means more jobs to travel to, but it's possible that in more rural settings, second jobs tend to be at home, "on the farm". As for the first result, it's possible that the difference between non-metropolitan women and men is due to different types of jobs chosen, typical gender roles, or simply to quirks in our particular sample.

In our second analysis, looking for the effects of commute time on well-being, we found no significant correlation between work travel time and any of our outcome variables: life rating, general health, happiness, sadness, or stress level. In our third analysis, we considered that there are aspects to commuting other than the amount of time people spend doing it. We thus turned to commuting stress level as a possible predictor of well-being. We saw that having one's stress heightened during work travel is strongly correlated with lower life ratings and poorer general health ratings.

Bolstering the observation, from Analyses 2 and 3, that commuting stress is more significant than commuting time, are the results of our fourth and final analysis. Here, we compared sleep time with both commute time and commute stress. We found that long commutes are not significantly correlated with sleep time, while stressful commutes predict less sleep, by about 22.5 minutes on average.

## Recommendations for Action

The takeaway from these results is that negative effects are associated, not with long commutes, but with high stress commutes. This finding suggests that if one wishes to minimize negative effects, it might be worthwhile to trade a high-stress commute for a more relaxing one, even if it takes more time. Conversely, switching from a long, calm commute to a shorter but more frenzied one might not be worth the savings in time. Of course, not all workers have the flexibility to make such choices, so it is worth asking what employers and policy makers can do with this information to bring about more systemic change.

From an employer's perspective, high stress commutes can take a toll on employee health and morale, which in turn can impact business performance and profitability. Understanding how workers get to work, and how that affects them, could lead to policy decisions that improve their lives, job satisfaction, and performance. For instance, would scheduling shifts to avoid rush hours be beneficial, and lead to smoother and happier shift changes? In a setting where public transit might be less stressful than driving, would it be worthwhile to incentivize its use? After all, employees who take the train don't take up a parking space in the company lot!

At a larger scale, public policy makers could take this information into account, when making decisions about public transport, highway development, and zoning. Perhaps a tax credit for businesses that offer remote or hybrid options to employees would pay for itself in terms of public health benefits.

## Questions for Further Study

The first question that suggests itself when looking at these results is this: What factors lead to higher stress commuting? In our first analysis, we examined factors that are correlated with longer commutes, but what if we asked similar questions about stressful commutes?

Is commuting more stressful at certain times of day? If so, it would strengthen the case for schedule flexibility. Are commutes more or less stressful according to the mode of commuting: by car, by public transit, by bicycle, on foot? If that's the case, then it would inform the possible benefits of policies that incentivize certain modes of travel, as well as decisions about where and when to provide bus or rail options, or bicycle paths. In general, understanding the causes of commuting stress would lead to greater ability to reduce such stress and its harms.

Additionally, it would be interesting to examine whether any factors exacerbate or mitigate the association between commute stress and negative outcomes. In other words, if one has a stressful commute, what else can one avoid or embrace in order to minimize the associated harms? Could commuters benefit from something as simple as not having stressful meetings scheduled at the beginning of a shift, when they've just stepped out of rush-hour traffic?

Anyone who works anywhere other than their own home has to get to work, in some way or another. The time spent doing so doesn't simply vanish; it can have positive or negative effects that reverberate throughout the commuter's day and life. It is worthwhile to pay attention to these effects, and to take reasonable steps to maximize the positive ones and minimize the negative ones. In this study, we have made initial inquiries that could lead to business or public policies producing tangible benefits for workers, their employers, and their communities.
