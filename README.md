# ATUS-Commute-Time-Analysis
In this report, we use data from the 2021 American Time Use Survey (ATUS) to analyze the role that commute time – time spent traveling to and from work – plays in the lives of Americans.

First, we investigate factors that influence commuting. Who spends a lot of time traveling to work, and why? Are those long trips about making more money? Are they about having second jobs? Do such factors mean more in the country or in the city? Do they mean more for men or for women?

Next we turn to the effects of commute time on general well being. Is work travel time correlated with life satisfaction, with general health, with happiness, sadness, or stress?

After that, we focus more closely on the quality of a commute over its quantity. After all, an hour driving through the countryside is very different from 20 minutes dashing through cutthroat traffic. Do those who report high levels of stress while commuting see downstream effects on their health and well-being?

An obvious way that commuting might affect one's life is that the hour you spend getting to work is another hour you could have spent sleeping! We look in detail at how sleep time is affected by commuting, both in terms of the length of the trip and how much stress it causes the commuter.
